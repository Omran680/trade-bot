## 🚧 Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations

1. **Single Timeframe**
   - Only 1H timeframe supported
   - Fix: Implement multi-timeframe in feature_extractor.py

2. **Single Asset**
   - Only XAU/USD supported
   - Fix: Generalize feature extraction for any asset

3. **Synthetic Data Only**
   - No real market data ingestion
   - Fix: Add data providers (Yahoo, IB, etc.)

4. **No Live Trading**
   - IG Markets API not fully implemented
   - Fix: Complete trader.py integration

5. **Limited Indicators**
   - 18 features may be insufficient
   - Fix: Add more technical indicators

6. **Meta-learner Simplistic**
   - Stacking uses heuristic, not learned
   - Fix: Train proper neural network meta-learner

### Performance Considerations

- Model size: ~150k parameters (can be optimized)
- Training speed: ~5-10 minutes per 50 episodes
- Memory usage: ~500MB with full buffers
- Inference speed: ~100ms per decision

## 💻 Development Tips

### Running Tests
```python
# Test individual components
from examples import *

# Run all examples
python examples.py

# Test specific scenario
from main import XAUUSDHybridTrader
trader = XAUUSDHybridTrader()
trader.trading_loop(prices, volumes, episodes=5)
```

### Debugging
```python
# Enable verbose logging
config.VERBOSE = True

# Print model architecture
trader.agent.hybrid_network.summary()

# Inspect decision making
print(ensemble_decision['breakdown'])

# Check feature values
print(trader.get_state(prices))
```

### Profiling
```python
import cProfile
import pstats

profiler = cProfile.Profile()
profiler.enable()

# Code to profile
trader.trading_loop(prices, volumes, episodes=1)

profiler.disable()
stats = pstats.Stats(profiler)
stats.sort_stats('cumulative')
stats.print_stats(10)
```

## 🏗️ Architecture Decisions

### Why Feature Sharing?
- Reduces parameters
- Speeds convergence
- Improves generalization
- Natural transfer learning

### Why Weighted Voting?
- Adaptive to performance
- Better than simple voting
- Interpretable
- Computationally efficient

### Why Ensemble at Decision Layer?
- Not at prediction layer (would be model merging)
- Provides voting mechanism
- Allows strategy switching
- Better for risk management

### Why GAE for PPO?
- Better variance reduction
- Standard in PPO implementations
- Proven empirically
- Flexibility with lambda parameter
